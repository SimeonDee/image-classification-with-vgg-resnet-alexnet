# image-classification-with-vgg-resnet-alexnet
My Project 1 Solution codes for My "AI Programming with Python" Nanodegree Course on Udacity for classifying Images. I used the pre-trained vgg, resnet and alexnet models, already trained on the Public ImageNet Dataset.

In this project, the results obtained from each model is stored in a separate txt file bearing the same name as the model used. There are two output text file for each model. the second file contains a brief and final output from the models, while the first file for each model are more like the outputs obtained during the testing stage. I included them both for anyone to be able to follow how the code works.

The screenshot of the result obtained is attached in tabular comparative form as a .jpg file.
